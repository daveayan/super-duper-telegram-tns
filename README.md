# super-duper-telegram-tns

Application built with NativeScript
- Uses application settings for local storage
- Does NOT send SMS. Need to fix that

To run
- tns platform add android
- tns platform add ios
- tns livesync android --emulator --watch
- tns livesync ios --emulator --watch

Note: ios will work with El Capitan and higher.
